* About

This is a SquashFS helper for Midnight Commander. Having it installed, you could
explore the content of your =squashfs= files the same way you do with =zip=,
=7z= etc.

*Notice*: When you access some file via a vfs layer in =mc=, the file gets
extracted into a temp dir (in order of precedence: =$MC_TMPDIR=, =$TMPDIR=,
=/tmp=). So, it is not a very bright idea to browse into a big squashfs file
inside some ISO image: the whole squash would be extracted into the temp dir.

* Requirements

The code is based on the =unsquashfs= tool. The package to install is usually
called =squashfs-tools=. Alternative package names: =squashfs= (NetBSD).
